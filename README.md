# Cell Models Package

This package is meant to contain all Christini Lab models that are implemented in Python. As of writing this, there are 3 models: O'Hara Rudy, Paci, and Kernik.

### Using and Installing this Project

This Python project is written in [Python Packaging format](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/). If you want to play around with the models quickly, you can `cd` into `cell-models/` and edit the `main.py` file. 

If you want to install these models locally, you can run `python3 setup.py build` and then `python3 setup.py install` from the project root. This will make the files in `cell-models/` globally available. 

### Tutorial

Go to `cell_models/example_code/main.py` to find functions with code that shows you how to get started running models with this codebase.
